# transfer_keras
The code probably doesn't work anymore, and it was anyways primarily about the concept of transfer learning.  Looking back on this project, it is debatable whether the code ever achieved the goal.  Project should be updated.

This project was created for a PyData Munich tutorial about transfer learning.  As it is about introductory concepts, any suggestions which might help people new to data science or machine learning are appreciated and could be updated.  I have focused on the theory, and a short example with Keras using a pre-trained NN model.  I am indebted to Nick del Grosso and Gasper Stukelj in particular for helping me learn more about Python and inspiring me to get involved with PyData!
