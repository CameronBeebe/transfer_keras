# transfer_keras
This project was created for a PyData Munich tutorial about transfer learning.  As it is about introductory concepts and learning, any suggestions which might help people new to data science or machine learning are appreciated.  My code is hacky, and I am indebted to Nick del Grosso and Gasper Stukelj in particular for helping me learn more about Python.
